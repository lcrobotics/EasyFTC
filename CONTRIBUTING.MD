### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to EasyFTC? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues][beginner] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

- Maintain EasyFTC's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Enable a sustainable system for EasyFTC's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:
